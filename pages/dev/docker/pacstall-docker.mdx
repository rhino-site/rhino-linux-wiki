## Pacstall Docker Images

For rapid containerized development of Pacstall, we provide Docker images served through the `ghcr.io` registry. These images ship with multiple different versions of Ubuntu and Debian, and are built for both `amd64/x86_64` and `arm64/aarch64` architectures.

### Distribution Bases
The following distribution bases (`distro-base`) are available:

`ubuntu-latest` - the latest LTS release of Ubuntu.

`ubuntu-rolling` - the latest stable release of Ubuntu (can be LTS or interim).

`ubuntu-devel` - the development branch for Ubuntu. Equivalent to Debian's Sid.

`debian-stable` - the latest stable release of Debian.

`debian-testing` - the next upcoming stable release of Debian.

`debian-unstable` - the development branch for Debian (aka Sid).

### Available Tags
The images can be reached from the following tags:

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:${version}`
- Images built and tagged when we release specific milestone versions. Can be any release `4.3.2` or later.

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:master`
- The latest version of the `master` branch.

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:master-${1a2b3c4d}`
- A specific commit of the `master` branch, given the first 8 characters of the commit hash.

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:develop`
- The latest version of the `develop` branch.

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:develop-${1a2b3c4d}`
- A specific commit of the `develop` branch, given the first 8 characters of the commit hash.

`ghcr.io/pacstall/${distro-base}:latest`
- The latest built image from either `master` or a tagged version (will never be from `develop`).

### Running Images

For quick setup information, select your platform below:

  <Tabs.Tab>
    If you have not already done so, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)* or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).
    
    If using only Docker Engine, it is highly recommended to also install the [Docker buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx)* plugin.

    *Docker Engine and buildx binaries are provided in the [`pacstall-programs`](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs) repository (for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures):  
    ```bash
    pacstall -I docker-bin docker-buildx-plugin-bin
    ```
    ---
    Run the following command in a terminal to pull the image:
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/pacstall/ubuntu-latest:latest
    ```
    Or swap `ubuntu-latest:latest` for another specified base and version.

    Then, you can run the following command to start it:
    ```bash
    docker run -it --net=host --privileged ghcr.io/pacstall/ubuntu-latest:latest bash
    ```

    ---

    You can also use [Pacstall Docker Builder](https://github.com/pacstall/docker/blob/master/README.md) to manage our images.

    To use `pacstall-docker-builder`, first clone and enter the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pacstall/docker && cd docker
    ```

    Now, to pull and start* an image, we can run:

    ```bash
    ./pacstall-docker-builder -p -t -d ubuntu:latest -v latest
    ```
    Or swap `ubuntu:latest` and `latest` for another specified base and version.

    *To pull without starting, drop the `-t` flag.
