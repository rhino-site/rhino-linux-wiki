## Pacstall 101: Creating a Pacscript

This page is a reference page containing most variables/arrays/functions that a person should reasonably expect to have when creating a pacscript. Below is a list of every base variable/function/array. Each will be explained in the sections that follow.

```bash
pkgbase="bar" # Package base name (only should be used for split packages)
pkgname=("foo" "barfoo") # Package name(s) (only an array if using pkgbase)
repology=("project: bar") # Repology reference for pacup
arch=('any' 'amd64' 'arm64') # Architectures that this program can build on
pkgver="1.0.0" # Upstream package version
pkgrel="3" # Counter for pacscript modifications past $pkgver
epoch="4" # Force a package to be seen as newer than any previous version
url='https://foo.com/bar' # Homepage for package
source=(
  "https://github.com/Elsie19/foo/archive/refs/tags/${pkgver}.zip"
