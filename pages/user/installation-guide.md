# Installation Guide

Here is the official installation guide for Rhino Linux **2024.2**. This guide assumes that you have created a bootable USB drive with a Rhino Linux disk image, if you have not, you can find guides online for how to create a Live bootable Linux USB on Windows, macOS or Linux. You can grab the latest Rhino Linux disk image [here](https://rhinolinux.org/download).

## Installation

### GRUB Bootloader
When you boot from your Live USB you will be greeted with the GRUB Bootloader, which is the most commonly used bootloader for Linux systems. You will want to select "Try or Install Rhino Linux" - Which should be selected by default, and press enter.

• Rhino Linux currently utilises unsigned kernels, this means that you may need to disable secureboot in your UEFI/BIOS beforehand.

### Booting to the Rhino Linux Desktop.

When you first boot into your live system, the installer will not automatically start, rather you are immediately given the chance to try Rhino Linux on your live USB. When you are ready to install Rhino Linux you can ***click on the icon on your desktop***, this will then launch our customised Calamares Installer.

- ***It is important to note that the icon for the installer does not currently display in Rhino Linux 2024.2, instead you are able to launch the installer through the applications grid, which can be launched either in the dock or by pressing `CTRL` + `A`***.
    - You are able to track this issue [here](#).

### Installer

When you first boot into the installer, you will be asked to select your language layout. Afterwards you will need to select your location so that the system can accurately grab your timezone. You will then need to select your keyboard layout, you are also able to test your keyboard layout to ensure it is correct.

You will then need to select how you will partition your disks, your usual options are to install alongside an existing operating system, erase the entire contents of the disk and install Rhino Linux or manually partition your disks. Finally you will need to provide a name, username, a name for your computer and then your password. Afterwards you will be given a summary of the changes you are about to make, and then you can confirm this and begin your install.

## Post-install

- Now that you have installed Rhino Linux, you are able to set up the OS to your liking. An active internet connection is required to complete these steps. 

### Setup Wizard

Upon logging into your Rhino Linux desktop you will be greeted with our setup wizard. This utility will allow for you to set up your device exactly how you need it, with options for additional package managers (such as Flatpak and Nix) to development tools like GitHub CLI and Distrobox.

- Apport is available as an option for testing, it is recommended that you do not enable apport unless it is for testing purposes. This is because Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other private material. **Do not enable Apport unless you are doing critical testing in a safe environment.**

One this has been completed you will be prompted to reboot your system; please reboot so that the changes can take affect.

Finally, once you have logged in, you will be urged to perform any upgrades to packages installed on your system. This can be done through the `Your System` application, or through running `rpk update -y`, which will update all packages from any package manager you have installed. After this has been completed you should reboot then install your applications.

- It is recommended for you to use rhino-pkg (aka: rpk) to manage packages on your system. You can read the documentation for rhino-pkg [here]().
