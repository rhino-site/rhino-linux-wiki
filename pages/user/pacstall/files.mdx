## Management Files

This manual page describes the format of the `pacstallrepo` and `update` files. These are simple text files which contain newline-separated information.

`/usr/share/pacstall/repo/pacstallrepo` - repository management file

`/usr/share/pacstall/repo/update` - update management file

---

### `pacstallrepo`

<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** This file is associated with the [`--add-repo`](commands#-a---add-repo) and [`--remove-repo`](commands#-rr---remove-repo) commands.
</Callout>

There is one optional component and one required component:

```
url @alias
```

Where `alias` is optional.

#### `url`

This is the raw URL to a git repository. This should *not* end in `.git`. This *should* normally end in `user/reponame`.

#### `alias`

This takes the form of `@alias` where `alias` can be anything alphanumeric. This would be useful if you wanted to do something like `pacstall -I pkg@pacstall` vs `pacstall -I pkg@enhanced` where `pacstall` is the official repository and `enhanced` is your repository with additional modifications, instead of `pacstall -I pkg@github:pacstall/pacstall-programs` and `pacstall -I pkg@github:me/pacstall-enhanced-repo`, or other various long links.

### `update`

<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** This file is associated with the [`--update`](commands#-u---update) command.
</Callout>

Usually, this file does not need to be manually updated. If `pacstall -U .` on a local repository is run, it will be set to `pacstall master`. This is the format the `update` file takes:

```
username branch
```

#### `username`

Since Pacstall is hosted on GitHub, the `update` file does not support anything except GitHub, and `username` will take the username where a repository named `pacstall` is created inside.

#### `branch`

This is the branch name, usually `master`.
This conversion keeps the structure intact while putting the relevant content into proper markdown code blocks.
