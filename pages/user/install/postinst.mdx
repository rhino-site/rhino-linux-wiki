## Post-Install

- Now that you have installed Rhino Linux, you are able to set up the OS to your liking. An active internet connection is required to complete these steps. 

### Setup Wizard

Upon logging into your Rhino Linux desktop you will be greeted with our setup wizard. This utility will allow for you to set up your device exactly how you need it, with options for additional package managers (such as Flatpak and Nix) to development tools like GitHub CLI and Distrobox.

- Apport is available as an option for testing, it is recommended that you do not enable apport unless it is for testing purposes. This is because Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other private material. **Do not enable Apport unless you are doing critical testing in a safe environment.**

One this has been completed you will be prompted to reboot your system; please reboot so that the changes can take affect.

Finally, once you have logged in, you will be urged to perform any upgrades to packages installed on your system. This can be done through the `Your System` application, or through running `rpk update -y`, which will update all packages from any package manager you have installed. After this has been completed you should reboot then install your applications.

- It is recommended for you to use `rhino-pkg` (alias: `rpk`) to manage packages on your system. You can read the documentation for `rhino-pkg` [here](../rpk).
